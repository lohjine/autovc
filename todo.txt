- actually can run with pretrained model to get a 0-shot baseline
  - wait this don't even need waveglow..
  - iirc, just generate noise, can try again
  - and can try, generate spec to itself, put to waveglow


- ensure mel spec input is the same
  - seems like n_mels = 80, can just use
  


- extract renai circulation voice (might as well do platinum disco, doesnt take that long)
  - do full song for more data
  - probably cut to the usual size of x secs, see what we did for illya?


- gen mel specs using waveglow


- gen metadata (for training -> train.pkl)
  - figure out one-hot embedding
  - test


- train using main.py
 - test using  vocoder.ipynb


- rewrite conversion.ipynb to work with other data, because it is doing many-to-many, we want 1-to-1
  - need to gen metadata.pkl ourselves
     - ['label',256, (x,80)]
     - 256->speaker embedding. x,80 -> melspec


- figure out how to save and resume training, using the saved checkpoints
  (in hparams - set checkpoint)
  - hmmm maybe training is fast? 1 million iterations
