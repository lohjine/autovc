- ensure mel spec input is the same


- extract renai circulation voice (might as well do platinum disco, doesnt take that long)


- gen mel specs using waveglow


- figure out one-hot embedding
  - test

- gen metadata




- train using main.py
 - test using  vocoder.ipynb



- figure out how to save and resume training, using the saved checkpoints
  (in hparams - set checkpoint)
  - hmmm maybe training is fast? 1 million iterations
